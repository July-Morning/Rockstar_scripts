Music takes your life
The world is threatened
Build the world up
While your life is greater than nothing 
Put the world into the song
Put the song of your life into the world
Knock your life down

Give back the world

Your enemy is a mirror     
Your mind is reflection
Until your mind is your enemy,
Put Music taking your mind into the truth
Build your mind up
Whisper the truth
